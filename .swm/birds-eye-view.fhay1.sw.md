`aocjs-cli` is a tool to help you write and submit answers for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

# What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles, one for each day from December 1->25 of every year.

Every puzzle gives you an "input" string that you process with any programming language, usually resulting in a single number or short string.

For instance, the puzzle for Day 1 of December 2020 was:

Given a list of numbers, find the 2 numbers that add up to 2020. Then return the **product** of those 2 numbers.

So for the list:

`1721 979 366 299 675 1456`

we have 1721 + 299 = 2020, so the submitted answer is 1721 \* 299 = **514579**.

# What does this program do with Advent of Code?

One way to experience Advent of Code is to try and solve each puzzle as soon as it is released, and secure a spot on a public or private leaderboard.

In order to answer a puzzle as fast as possible, `aocjs-cli` helps by setting up your programming environment and submitting your answer directly from the command line.

For instance, when you run `npx start aoc day1`, the script will download your input to a file called `day1.txt` , create a file called `day1.ts`, and begin watching that file.

Whenever the `day1.ts` file changes, it compiles and runs the Typescript code and prints the result. If you think you have the right answer, you can submit that answer right from the terminal.

## Endpoints

To accomplish the above, `aocjs-cli` uses endpoints from the Advent of Code website.

The puzzle input for a given day and year can be found at an endpoint like `https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1/input`, and you submit your answer by a POST request to an endpoint like `https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1/answer`

<br/>

To authenticate to these endpoints, you grab your session token with the Chrome Inspector and put it in a local configuration file: [https://aocjs.github.io/guide/data/#how-to-retrieve-your-cookie](https://aocjs.github.io/guide/data/#how-to-retrieve-your-cookie)
